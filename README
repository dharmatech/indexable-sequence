An indexable sequence is one which supports the following operations:

    size seq       Get the length
    ref  i         Get the element at i
    put! i val     Set the element at i
    new-of-size n  Make a new sequence of size n

'define-indexable-sequence-procedures', when given these procedures
for a particular data type, will generate the following procedures:

    fold-left  seq val proc
    fold-right seq val proc
    for-each seq proc
    for-each-with-index seq proc
    copy seq
    map! seq proc
    map  seq proc
    subseq seq start end
    take seq n
    drop seq n
    filter-to-reverse-list seq proc
    filter seq proc
    index seq proc
    find seq proc
    swap! seq i j
    reverse! seq
    reverse seq

The procedures are defined using names based on the data type. For
example, the following expression:

    (define-indexable-sequence-procedures
      vector
      vector-length
      vector-ref
      vector-set!
      make-vector)

will generate the following procedures:

    vector-fold-left
    vector-fold-right
    vector-for-each
    vector-for-each-with-index
    vector-copy
    vector-map!
    vector-map
    vector-subseq
    vector-take
    vector-drop
    vector-filter-to-reverse-list
    vector-filter
    vector-index
    vector-find
    vector-swap!
    vector-reverse!
    vector-reverse

Libraries are provided for the following data types:

    vector
    string
    f64-vector  (based on R6RS bytevectors)
    f32-vector  (based on R6RS bytevectors)

SETUP

    $ cd ~/scheme # Where '~/scheme' is the path to your Scheme libraries
    $ git clone git://github.com/dharmatech/indexable-sequence.git

To run the tests:

    $ scheme --script ~/scheme/indexable-sequence/test-vector.sps
